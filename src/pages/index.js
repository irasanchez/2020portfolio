              his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the shadow
              of the console. The Sprawl was a square of faint light. Then a
              mist closed over the black water and the robot gardener. Case had
              never seen him wear the same suit twice, although his wardrobe
              seemed to consist entirely of meticulous reconstruction‚Äôs of
              garments of the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright
              void beyond the hull.

            A document I made for other Lambda School students who struggle with
            soft skills, particularly communication for networking and
            professional environments, includes information for remote
            communication skills as well.

            I made this drill for the first group of students I tutored at
            Lambda School to help them practice writing passing props in React,
            a tool used to dynamically render data across different parts of the
            app.
