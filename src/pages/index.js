            A document I made for other Lambda School students who struggle with
            soft skills, particularly communication for networking and
            professional environments, includes information for remote
            communication skills as well.

            I made this drill for the first group of students I tutored at
            Lambda School to help them practice writing passing props in React,
            a tool used to dynamically render data across different parts of the
            app.
